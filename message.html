      Hey Jeff, I would like to thank you so much for coming to our class on Thursday! It was so interesting to hear your experiences and insights on acquisitions and funding based on your own career path and what you'd advise looking back at your previous decisions. I'm sorry that this passed 140 characters... But with jokes aside, I wish you all the luck with Twitter and can't wait to see what new innovations and products you guys have for the future!
